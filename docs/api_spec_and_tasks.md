## Required Python third-party packages
```python
"""
scrapy==2.5.0
beautifulsoup4==4.9.3
pandas==1.2.4
"""
```

## Required Other language third-party packages
```python
"""
No third-party packages required in other languages.

```

## Full API spec
```python
"""
No API spec required as the project is a web crawler and doesn't provide an API.

```

## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application. It uses the Crawler, Parser, and DataHandler classes."),
    ("crawler.py", "Implements the Crawler class. This class is responsible for crawling the website and returning the HTML."),
    ("parser.py", "Implements the Parser class. This class is responsible for parsing the HTML returned by the Crawler."),
    ("data_handler.py", "Implements the DataHandler class. This class is responsible for saving the data returned by the Parser."),
    ("settings.py", "Contains the settings for the Crawler. This file should be created first as it is a prerequisite for the Crawler.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "settings.py",
    "crawler.py",
    "parser.py",
    "data_handler.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'settings.py' file contains the settings for the Crawler. These settings include the URL to be crawled, the depth of the crawl, and any other parameters required by the Scrapy framework.

The 'crawler.py' file uses the Scrapy framework to crawl the specified website and return the HTML. The 'parser.py' file uses BeautifulSoup to parse this HTML and extract the required data.

The 'data_handler.py' file uses Pandas to save this data in a DataFrame and then save it in the specified format (e.g., CSV, Excel, etc.).

The 'main.py' file is the main entry point of the application. It uses the Crawler, Parser, and DataHandler classes to perform the web crawling task.

```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The complexity of the project may vary depending on the structure of the insurance company websites. Some websites may require more complex crawling and parsing strategies. Therefore, the design and implementation of the crawler, parser, and data handler may need to be adjusted accordingly.
